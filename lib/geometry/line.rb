=begin rdoc
A cluster of objects representing a Line of infinite length

Supports two-point, slope-intercept, and point-slope initializer forms

== Usage

=== Two-point constructors
    line = Geometry::Line[[0,0], [10,10]]
    line = Geometry::Line[Geometry::Point[0,0], Geometry::Point[10,10]]
    line = Geometry::Line[Vector[0,0], Vector[10,10]]

=== Slope-intercept constructors
    Geometry::Line[Rational(3,4), 5]	# Slope = 3/4, Intercept = 5
    Geometry::Line[0.75, 5]

=== Point-slope constructors
    Geometry::Line(Geometry::Point[0,0], 0.75)
    Geometry::Line(Vector[0,0], Rational(3,4))

===  Special constructors (2D only)
    Geometry::Line.horizontal(y=0)
    Geometry::Line.vertical(x=0)
